            "article": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgiva said that India and China are expected to account for half of the global growth in 2023. She added that the world economy is expected to grow at lower than 3 per cent this year.\n\n\"Some momentum comes from emerging economies Asia especially is a bright spot. India and China are expected to account for half of the global growth in 2023. But others face a steeper climb,\" Georgieva told the news agency PTI.\n\nShe further warned that a sharp slowdown in the world economy last year triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war could linger on this year as well. The Russia-Ukraine crisis led to the global growth rate in 2022 dropping by almost half from 6.1 per cent to 3.4 per cent, Georgieva added.\n\nBut for how long is this slow growth phase going to last? The IMF boss believes that the phase of slower economic activity will be prolonged as the next five years will witness less than 3 per cent growth. This, according to the IMF chief, is “our lowest medium-term growth forecast since 1990, and well below the average of 3.8 per cent from the past two decades.”\n\nShe added that slower growth will make it more challenging for the low-income countries to catch up. She explained, “Poverty and hunger could further increase, a dangerous trend that was started by the COVID crisis.”\n\nGeorgieva added that lower-income countries will be crippled with high borrowing costs at a time of weakening demand for their exports. She also noted that about 90 per cent of advanced economies are projected to witness a decline in growth rates in 2023.\n\nTalking about the banking crisis, Georgieva said while the global banking system had “come a long way” since the 2008 crisis, “concerns remain about vulnerabilities that may be hidden, not just at banks but also non-banks.”\n\n\"Now is not the time for complacency,\" she said while signing off."

            "article": "India's services sector has rebounded at a record rate in the three months from April to June despite the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. The services sector, which includes various industries such as retail, hotels, transportation, and communication, among others, is a key driver of India's economy. The remarkable recovery of the sector has contributed significantly to the country's economic growth.\n\nAccording to data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, the services sector grew at a record rate of 12.4% during the said period. This impressive growth rate comes despite the challenges posed by the second wave of COVID-19 during those months. It indicates the resilience of the Indian economy and the adaptability of businesses in coping with the pandemic's impact.\n\nThe services sector's revival is a positive sign for India as it seeks to overcome the adverse effects of the pandemic. It not only provides a much-needed boost to the economy but also indicates the gradual recovery of the overall business environment in the country. The growth in the services sector is expected to create more job opportunities and further drive economic activities across various related industries.\n\nAs the pandemic's impact continues to wane, it is crucial for the government and businesses to sustain this positive momentum and foster an environment that enables the services sector to thrive. Additionally, focusing on technological advancements and digitalization can further enhance the sector's growth prospects and make it more resilient to future challenges.\n\nThe government's role in providing necessary support, implementing favorable policies, and ensuring a conducive business environment will be vital in ensuring the sustained growth of India's services sector.

            "article": "In response to the surging inflation and rising concerns over the Indian economy's stability, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has raised its key interest rates by 0.75 percentage point, bringing it to 5.75%. This is the highest interest rate in the country in the past five years.\n\nThe decision to hike interest rates comes as the RBI aims to combat the soaring inflation, which has been a cause for worry among policymakers and citizens alike. The increasing prices of essential goods and services have put a strain on households and disrupted economic activities.\n\nThe RBI has taken a proactive stance to curb inflation and stabilize the economy. While the move may have an impact on borrowing costs and investment decisions in the short term, it is a necessary step to address the inflationary pressures and maintain financial stability.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the central bank's action has raised concerns among some industry experts and businesses. They worry that higher interest rates could lead to decreased consumer spending and reduced demand, affecting industries that are already grappling with the pandemic's repercussions.\n\nThe RBI also revised its GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal year, predicting a slower growth rate of 6.3% due to the inflationary challenges. The bank emphasized the need for coordinated efforts from both the government and monetary authorities to address the economic situation effectively.\n\nAmidst the tightening monetary policy, the RBI assured that it would closely monitor the economic developments and take necessary actions as required. The central bank remains committed to managing inflation and fostering a conducive economic environment for sustainable growth in the long run."
